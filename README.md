# CPU Design and Simulation Project

This repository hosts two related tools:

- **Numeric tool binary** – a command-line utility for numeric analysis routines.
- **CPU simulator binary** – a virtual CPU environment for experimenting with instruction sets.

To run future entry points during development, use the Python module runner, e.g.

```bash
python -m src.cli.numeric_main
```
